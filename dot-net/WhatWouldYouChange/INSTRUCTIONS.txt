Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below.Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment. 
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	1. The program should allow the user to specify the file to be opened as a command line parameter; this can be implemented by supplying args[0] as a parameter to exampleClass.ExampleMethod() in 
	Program.Main, instead of it being hardcoded as it is now (and the hardcoded example has a typo in any case!)
	
	2. In the try block in ExampleClass.ExampleMethod(), the creation of the StreamReader should be incorporated into a using statement and block, which should then wrap the ReadToEnd() method call.
	This will help to ensure that the StreamReader resource is closed properly after it is used.

	3. In the catch block in ExampleClass.ExampleMethod(), instead of using a succession of standard string assignments to set the default value of the string, a verbatim string literal using the @ 
	symbol should be used instead.  This will make the default value more readable, and not clutter it up with a large number of newline escape characters.  Also, potentially a brief message indicating
	that there was an issue reading the file, and that the displayed text is a default, can be added to the beginning of the string.

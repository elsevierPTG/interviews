Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes (in priority order) within ExampleClass.cs:	
    1) From a functionality standpoint, ExampleMethod appears to store identical text in the exampleText property
        whether it successfully reads the text file by the given name or not. Since that's all this method does,
        I'd recommend the following:
            - Remove the exampleText property (so the text is closed to client modification)
            - Update the method to a GetExampleText function that accepts no parameters and returns the text.
        Taking this approach removes a lot of complexity and potential issues, including garbage collection for
        the filesystem/streamreader due to the lack of a using statement and latency within the catch block due
        to brute force string concatenation.

    2) I'd also recommend centralizing the text in a resource file. This way the reference to it is strongly typed
        rather than referred to by filename (read: a string) which is subject to typos.

    3) A very minor, nice-to-have would be placing the using statements within the namespace declaration. As you define
        your own objects, placing them in the namespace can both make your using statements more succint and in very rare
        cases mitigate runtime collisions with similarly named objects.

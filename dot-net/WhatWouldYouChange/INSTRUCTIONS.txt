Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	1.) Program.cs
		- Should be "ExampleText.txt" not "ExampleTexttxt"
	2.) ExampleClass.cs
		- The catch should be utilized to catch errors, not aggregate text from the file.
		- Check if the file exists before attempting to open it.
		- Instead of adding the text each time use while(streamReader.Peek() >= 0) { text+=streamReader.ReadLine() }

Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	1) A StringBuilder should be used in the Catch block because when concatenating a string another instance is created in memory.
	2) The newline character should be added with something like sb.AppendLine(); so as to clean up the code.
	3) File.ReadLines may be a better choice for reading the file in the Try block because it doesn't read the entire file into memory
		I also find the foreach block more intuitive and easier to read. If the strategy of reading the file into memory is desired,
		the File.ReadAllLines accomplishes the same goal as the StreamReader and the code is also more succinct.

Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below.Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment. 
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	1) In Program.cs pass a valid file name into ExampleMethod. "ExampleTexttxt" should be "ExampleText.txt"
	2) In Program.cs the Main method takes an extraneous string array "args" that isn't being referenced anywhere. This can be removed for clarity of code.
	3) The class Program and method Main aren't descriptive of the actions they accomplish. I would move the code inside of Main into its own method called 
		FileToConsole or something otherwise more self explantory and call that from Main instead. The methods names don't explain their purpose.
	4) Similarly in ExampleClass.cs, ExampleMethod doesn't explain what it does. I'd rename to something like ReadFromFile
	5) In ExampleClass.cs, I wouldn't used a try/catch block in ExampleMethod especially with how it's currently duplicating proper functionality in reading 
		from the sameple text file. Right now that method is silently failing without the end user knowing and any changes to the sample file won't be seen.
		Instead I would use File. Exists to check that we have a valid path before opening the file. If a file does not exist I would either throw an exception 
		or otherwise inform the end user that the requested file was not found so that the problem can be fixed.
	6) The string builder in the catch statement in ExmapleClass.cs is a bit messy. If that needed to exist I'd clean that up to either be in one big text block with text = @"" or at
		least append text using text += "".
	7) Having exampleText as a global public string in ExampleClass seems unecessary and potentially confusing if other methods are referencing it. It doesn't seem 
		to need to exist at all as nothing is setting to it and it can be removed in favor of having ExampleMethod return the string variable text. This would
		require an update on line 13 of Program.cs to be Console.Write(exampleClass.ExampleMethod("ExampleText.txt")); and line 11 can be deleted.

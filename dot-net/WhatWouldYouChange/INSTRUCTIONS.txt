Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:

Snippet
- Use more descriptive names, though in this case it makes some sense not to go overboard. Specifically ExampleMethod() could have been ReadExampleFile().
 
- Property should start with a capital letter. (ExampleText)
 
- Catch specific exceptions in this case at least: catch (FileNotFoundException e) 
 
- Use using statement to handle the disposal of the File and StreamReader
 
- Don't concantenate the text in the catch block. use the "@" string prefix ex:
text = @"Lorem ipsum dolor
facilisis auctor
euismod nisi" 
 
- Depending on the use case it may be worth converting the fail state (Lorem ipsum...) text into a constant and moving it into a seperate file.
 
- Add guard clauses for the filename parameter.
	- empty
	- not null
	- does the file exist (though only needed if we need to do something specific on that error condition ie logging )
 
- Add logging, especially in the catch block.
 
- Don't start the catch block with text = text + "...". There is the possiblity that the text variable may contain part of the stream. I think it's unlikely but always better to be safe.
 
- In this case the text varaible is unnecessary assignments could be made directly to the property exampleText.
 
- Unless there is a reason not to, make the setter private.

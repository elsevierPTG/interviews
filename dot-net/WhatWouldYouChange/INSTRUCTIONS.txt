Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	To start, I would convert the fs and streamreader variables to utilize using statements to ensure that the objects are correctly disposed of in the ExampleMethod method of the ExampleClass.cs.
	Secondly, I would also include an a generic Exception object as an argument in the catch block of the ExampleMethod method of the ExampleClass.cs in order to display a more meaningful and descriptive indication of the error encountered in the program, instead of a blind failure.

Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment.
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	In c#, for multi line string we can use verbatim string that start with @ symbol. It tells to compiler
	to ignore the escape characters. Another advantage is using @ the string can formatted in human readable format.
	Also, it will be a lot of work if we use += to append the string because everytime we append a text to string, c# 
	makes a whole new string. If we have many lines of text to append to string, the appending will take some time.
	for e.g. below string
	text = text + "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis non pulvinar sapien, nec accumsan justo. Suspendisse";
    text = text + "\n";
    text = text + "facilisis auctor tortor, a maximus erat feugiat eu. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.Proin at";
    text = text + "\n";

	can also be written as 
	text = text + @"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis non pulvinar sapien, nec accumsan justo. Suspendisse
					facilisis auctor tortor, a maximus erat feugiat eu. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.Proin at";

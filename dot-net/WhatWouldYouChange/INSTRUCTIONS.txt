Objective:
	Review the ExampleProgram console application. Do not modify or refactor the code. Instead describe any changes 
	you think should be made in the section below.Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this entire assignment. 
        Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.


Suggested Changes:
	1-  static class would be better choice for the given scope of the program. IMHO
	2-  the resources used by IO operation should be release and disposed of properly.
	3-  StringBuilder would be better choice for string variable "text".IMHO
	4-  we could pass file name by using App.config file.IMHO
	5-	a little validation for file name would be better.IMHO
	6-	usually it's better, handling exceptions with appropriate exception types e.g. IOException.
	7	if memory is concern then all this could be done by simply returning the StringBuilder text variable and writing-off the global string property completely.

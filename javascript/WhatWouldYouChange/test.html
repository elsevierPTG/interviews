Answers:
I'm writing my answers here so preserve line numbers above as I add answers.
1. Line 17 is missing a semicolon. JavaScript does automatic semicolon insertion, but there are certain circumstances
wherein incorrect behavior can result from not adding semicolons manually. In particular, if the next line starts with
certain characters, the interpreter will continue the statement with the code on the next time. I don't recall
the full list of those characters, but one I recall is "(".
2. On line 20, the reqFlds variable is declared without using "var" (or "const" or "let", if ES6 were supported for this).
That not good because doing so implicitly declares reqFlds as a global variable
(for JS in a browser, makes it an attribute of the window object). That variable is best scoped, with minimally required
access, to the lexical scope of the validateField function. That's because, in general, software is best written with least access as a
guiding principle, and globals are a general antipattern.
3. Line 21 sets the first element in the array using array index notation. That element could have been pushed into the array,
as is done on line 22. The reason that is better, is that it avoids magic numbers (in this case 0), and would be consistent
with line 22.
4. In fact, lines 20-22 could be combined into a simpler statement: var reqFlds = ['username', 'password']. That
statement both declares and initializes the reqFlds array. That would be better because it would be less code, and make it
easier to understand at a glance what is happening.
5. The reqFlds array could, in my opinion, have its identifier name improved. I would suggest requiredFields. That would
be better because the identifier would very directly state what it was for, so readers would not have to spend any time
deciphering it.
6. As a further improvement, the reqFlds array could be eliminated entirely, because it simply holds two strings that
are later de-referenced by array index. Instead, the strings could be used literally (or each made a variable with the
typical constant naming convention: VARIABLE_NAME). That would be better because it would be less code and it would
make the code easier to follow. The result would be, for example document.getElementById('username').
7. The if statement on line 24 has unusual formatting. I would format it like this, for readability by keeping with
commonly accepted conventions:
if(document.getElementById(reqFlds[0]).value !== '' && document.getElementById(reqFlds[1]).value !== '').
8. There should not be a new line after the return keyword on line 34. That's because that's not the commonly accepted
convention, and it adds another line of code unnecessarily.
9. The code will not actually have the apparently desired effect, because the variable 'submitButtonIsActive' does not
have the same name as the variable 'submitButtonActive'. So the names should should be merged to single name.
That will then allow the return value of "validateField" to be logged to the console, rather than "false" always being logged.
10. document.getElementById('submitButton') is in two places. Since it is needed in both branches, it could be extracted
to a single variable declaration. That would eliminate that code duplication. The advantage of that is that if, for example,
the id changes (or the lookup attribute is changed from id to class), the code would only need to be changed in one place.

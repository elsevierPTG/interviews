/**

TODO refactor the Car to use dependency injection of the engine
TODO allow use of either a gas engine or electric engine. 
TODO make sure we have no-op implementations of both engines.

*/
public class Exercise2 {

	public static class Car {
		
		private GasEngine engine = new GasEngine();
		
		public Car() {
		}
		
		public void moveForward() {
			engine.spinWheels();

	public static class GasEngine {
		public void spinWheels() {

Solution:
public interface GasEngine{
	public void spinWheels();
}

public static class Car 
{
  private GasEngine engine;

  @Inject
  public Car(GasEngine engine){
    this.engine = engine;
  }
  public void moveForward() {
    engine.spinWheels();
  }
	
}

Plan for implementation

In order to keep this as simple and streamlined as possible, 
I won't be using any frameworks, with the exception
of jQuery since it makes it much faster to build up elements
in the DOM, and Bootstrap as it makes it much easier to set up
styling. I will be using JavaScript's build in fetch method to
process Ajax requests just to make it clear I know what's going
on under the hood.

I will be accessing the REST api directly; it wasn't clear from
the test assignment whether I was expected to make use of the FHIR
JavaScript client but again, this is another layer of complexity
that will get in the way of this faster implementation (I could easily 
spend half of my time just reading through the documentation).

Fortunatly the REST api provided by Cerner’s open sandbox is very
straightforward.

It appears that I can get all of the data I need just from the
Patient URL to search for matching patients:

    https://fhir-open.sandboxcerner.com/dstu2/0b8a0111-e8e6-4c26-a91c-5069cbc6b1ca/Patient?name=<name>

The patient details are pulled from the patient resource URL:

    https://fhir-open.sandboxcerner.com/dstu2/0b8a0111-e8e6-4c26-a91c-5069cbc6b1ca/Patient/<id>

And finally the conditions can be found by searching with the patient ID:

    https://fhir-open.sandboxcerner.com/dstu2/0b8a0111-e8e6-4c26-a91c-5069cbc6b1ca/Condition?patient=<patientId>

Final implementation will be a simple search box for searching for a patient.
Patient results will be displayed in a list, clicking on a patient's name will pull up their record.

Things I would implement if I had more time:
- a routing systema and history, so that navigation could be preserved and each request would have a corresponding URI
- a more robust testing system to make sure everything behaves as expected
- a more elegant interface, probably making use of a framework
- caching to reduce the number of redundant request to the REST api

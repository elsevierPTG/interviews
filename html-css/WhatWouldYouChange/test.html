Instructions
(~10 minutes):

This markup displays ok. Nonetheless please note up to 10 things that look bad to you, including a brief note as to why.

Example things to consider:
* Consistency
* HTML validity
* Likely anti patterns in the associated CSS (not supplied)
* Accessibility
* The content itself

Bonus point for the correct use of the word "semantic" in an answer.

+ bold might benefit from a span tag to not conflict with CSS
+ ID is caps
+ indentation is not clear - what elements contain other elements
+ <br> might benefit from a list
+ <p> might actually be a <ul>
+ <p> closing tag bad
+ redSection not very descriptive id
+ might benefit from some classes
+ information might need to be contained in a form
+ paragraphs are for reading not for listing
-->

<div ID=redSection>
    <p class="recruitment-question">Select <b>your favorite</b> javascript framework:<br />
        <input type="checkbox" value="angular" /> Angular JS<br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="jquery" /> JQuery.<br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="reactjs" /> React JS<p>
</div>

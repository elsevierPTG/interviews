Instructions
(~10 minutes):

This markup displays ok. Nonetheless please note up to 10 things that look bad to you, including a brief note as to why.

Example things to consider:
* Consistency
* HTML validity
* Likely anti patterns in the associated CSS (not supplied)
* Accessibility
* The content itself

Bonus point for the correct use of the word "semantic" in an answer.

        <input type="checkbox" value="angular" /> Angular JS<br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="jquery" /> JQuery.<br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="reactjs" /> React JS<p>

<!--Answers:
I am putting the answers after the code in order to preserve line numbers in the code while I'm writing the answers.
1. the "id" attribute in the div on line 25 is capitalized. I would make is lowercase. That's because lowercase is the widely accepted
convention for HTML tag attributes.
2. The value of the ID attribute for the div on line 25 missing quotation marks around it. That change is needed because
it won't work without the quotation marks. Correct is: <div id="redSection">
3. The p tag on line 26 is not semantic markup, so it should be changed to a div.
That's because surrounds an input section, not a paragraph of freeform text.
4. The class name (recruitment-question) for the p tag on line 26 is not very declarative, because the element in
which it resides is a container for both the question and the answers. A more declarative name could be "recruitment-selection"
for the question and answer, or "recruitment-question" if the element were to only wrap the prompt/question part of the HTML.
5. The b tags on line 26 are an antipattern, because they mix the concerns of markup and styling. A better choice would
be a span tag with a class for which there is a css rule of font-weight: bold
 (ideally a "framework-level" class used everywhere bold is needed).
6. There is an extra space after the br and before the closing slash in the br tag on line 26. Also, self-closing tags
don't need the slash in the HTML5 specification I believe (unlike XHTML).
7. For the input tags, self-closing tags don't need the slash in the HTML5 specification I believe (unlike XHTML).
8. The input tags allow for multiple selections, due to being of type checkbox. Since the prompt asks for the user's
favorite framework, it is implied that only one of the three can be selected at a given time. To do that, the input tag type
should be changed to radio.
9. br tags are used for line breaks. More typical is to use divs. That's because divs allow you to style/lay out the element
as a whole. For example, if we wanted to give each input section(checkbox and label) a margin-top of 10px, a div with a class
on it would accomplish both items.
10. The markup is not arranged in a typical way. For example, the opening and closing p tags are not directly above/below
each other. Arranging the markup in a typical way helps developers to visualize the layout and see problems more easily.
The prompt text would also typically be on a new line after the opening p tag (although the p tag should be a div as noted earlier).

Instructions
(~10 minutes):

This markup displays ok. Nonetheless please note up to 10 things that look bad to you, including a brief note as to why.

Example things to consider:
* Consistency
* HTML validity
* Likely anti patterns in the associated CSS (not supplied)
* Accessibility
* The content itself

Bonus point for the correct use of the word "semantic" in an answer.

Some things that I would change are:
1. I would begin replacing the redSection div with symantic markup such as Article.
2. The 'ID' should be lowercase.
3. The id 'redSection' needs to be surrounded by quotation marks.
4. The recruitment question indicates there is a select but a select is not used. Either (a) implement a select element or (b) use radio buttons if only one favorite is allowed.
5. The br tag should be removed and instead use CSS for line break as this does not make sense to screen readers.
6. The p tag should begin and end at the same character position using tabs or spacing.

    <p class="recruitment-question">Select <b>your favorite</b> javascript framework:<br />
        <input type="checkbox" value="angular" /> Angular JS<br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="jquery" /> JQuery.<br>
        <input type="checkbox" value="reactjs" /> React JS<p>
</div>
